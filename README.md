# Aunt Boots Diet

So Aunt Boots has to go on a low-histamine diet. You can't eliminate them totally. You have to do your best. Maybe you do a strict diet for weeks and then introduct foods one at the time.

I will summarize the diet this way:
* No gluten
* Nothing fermented, like yogurt & aged cheeses
* Nothing fermented, like vinegar, ketchup, and soysauce
* Nothing red, like strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, and other nightshades, including potatoes
* Meat needs to be from frozen to cooked to serve. No sausages, ground meat.

I think it is better to focus on what I CAN eat. So I have made this booklet.
