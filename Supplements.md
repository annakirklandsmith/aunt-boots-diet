# Supplements

FYI, I will be getting the results from a [Cyrex panel] (https://www.cyrexlabs.com/CyrexTestsArrays) to find out exactly what I am sensitve to. 

## Quercetin
I have a  "allergy and sinus support" products. The target ingredient is quercetin. Mine also has Bromelein, Citrus bioflavanoids, Nettle Leaf, and Vitamin C, Magnesium comes with those. This is what is making me feel like someone has poured aloe on my insides.

## Digestive Enzymes
Mine is called "Digestive Enzymes" and has about 18 different enzymes ending in -ase.

## Diamine Oxidase (DOA)
This specifically targets the histamines in the body, shutting them down. My product is called "Histamine Block"

## Pea Shoots
I learned that pea shoots are high in DOA. So I bought some snow pea seed and have started to sprout them. I will add them to my soups.

## Intermittent Fasting
One of my problems in my cluster is that my body doesn't seem to have nights and days. I don't relax at night. (I wasn't always like this). This is associated with a different kind of histamines. So I am also experimenting with eating only between 5 & 9 pm each day. This is called intermittent fasting.
